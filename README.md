# Baseball Statistics

Baseball is a game full of statistics, and most of those statistics have been consistently and carefully tracked going back to the late 1800s. That makes professional baseball a playground for data analysts. Here I look at interesting correlations between players, their stats, and their salaries.

* **1_Data_Preparation:** imports and functions, loaded by each of the analysis workbooks
* **2_Pitching**: analysis of pitching stats
* **3_Teams**: analysis of individual teams, with an emphasis on the San Francisco Giants
* **4_Hall_of_Fame:** characteristics of Hall of Famers
* **5_Batting:** analysis of batting stats

**Data Source:** [Lahman's Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/). The data set I used was through the 2018 season.
